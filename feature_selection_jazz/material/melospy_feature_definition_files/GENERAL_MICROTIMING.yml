        description: 'Swing ratios of beats with a binary sub-division as the ratio duration of the first to the second quaver in a beat. The first duration is set to 1. A swing ratio value of ``s`` means a proportion ``1:s``. Straight binary eigths have a value of 1 (1:1), whereas triplet eights get 0.5, since 1:0.5 = 2:1.'
